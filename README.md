# OOP-Summative
Procedural code is a step by step instructions for the computer to follow, while OOP allows for multiple values to be stored and interacted with collectively through objects,allowing for multiple copies of something  to exist without the need to repeatedly create separate objects with identical behaviors. 
Said behaviours are also easier to create, as information about the class is retained as long as an instance of it exists. 

To achieve  this through Procedural code, every object would need to constantly be updated independently by calling functions over and over again. Variables would need to be stored between instances of each function and there would be noticeable delay as every individual object has every individual property changed step by step.

Playing this game if it was created using Procedural code would feel really awful, the fact that every value would need to change individually one after the other, instead of simultaneously with each object running the procedural code to make it work instead of the external code running every aspect (Dispatching) , thus making the game slower. 

The benefits of OOP are that it is often much easier to work with than Procedural code, because it allows to create objects with stored properties that can be accessed anytime. This also means that OOP can be used to create complex programs with much less overall code.

The main drawback that I have noticed to OOP is that bug fixing is much harder. While fixing problems with Procedural code can often be more tedious, as there is often more code to work with, and therefore more that will need to be changed because of an intended occurrence, these occurrences are more frequent and harder to find when working with OOP. This is because OOP allows for more interaction between objects. Interaction between the user and the program, or even different elements of the program, occurs more frequently and under more varied conditions when using OOP, this leads to more and harder to find bugs when objects interact in ways you didnâ€™t account for.
